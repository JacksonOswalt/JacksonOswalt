### Yo 👋

I'm Jackson Oswalt and I'm the yougest person to build a functional IEC nuclear fusion reactor (at 12 years old). I'm currently a student at USC's Iovine and Young Academy. I'm an Atlas Fellow, and I'm funded by Tyler Cowen and Thiel Foundation via. Emergent Ventures.

I'm currently working on AI-enabled HCIs and agentic hardware, with an evolving interest in Defense tech as well.
