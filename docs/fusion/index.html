            <h1>I Built a Nuclear Fusion Reactor at 12 Years Old</h1>

            <img src="../assets/images/fusion/writing1.png" alt="Jackson Oswalt next to his fusion reactor">

            <p>At 12 years old, I designed and built an inertial electrostatic confinement nuclear fusion reactor, successfully producing a verifiable fusion reaction at home.</p>

            <p>The reactor works by generating an electric potential difference within a vacuum chamber. With a significant enough potential difference, atoms are hurled at each other with enough energy to overcome the coulomb force.</p>
                    
            <img src="../assets/images/fusion/diagram.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px;" alt="Diagram of D-D fusion reaction">

            <p>If deuterium is introduced to the chamber, a D-D fusion reaction can occur. 50% of these fusion reactions produce a neutron alongside a He-3 atom, and these neutrons are used to prove the reaction has occurred. I designed and calibrated my own system for thermalizing and detecting neutrons.</p>

            <p>Despite its inability to provide sustainable electricity to the power grid, this style of reactor does serves numerous purposes in research and in the production of radioisotopes for medical use.</p>

            <h2>Skills:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Design</li>
                <li>Welding/soldering</li>
                <li>Basic circuitry</li>
                <li>High-vacuum system design</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition to the more tangible skills listed above, this project gave me a lot of practice in producing scrappy solutions: often times I would buy something very cheaply on eBay, modify it to fit my needs, and then implement it into the reactor system.</p>

            <p>Though this may be a cliche, the most important skill I learned was persevering through prolonged adversity and challenges. Weeks would often go by with no observable change in progress, and yet I was able to stick to my convictions and power through these dissuading times.</p>

            <p>I also gained significant experience with presenting my work and public speaking, as I was invited to present to groups of academics and seasoned professionals in this space.</p>
