            <h1>I Built a Nuclear Fusion Reactor at 12 Years Old</h1>

            <img src="assets/images/fusion/writing1.png">

            <p>At 12 years old, I designed and built an inertial electrostatic confinement nuclear fusion reactor, successfully producing a verifiable fusion reaction at home.</p>

            <p>The reactor works by generating an electric potential difference within a vacuum chamber. With a significant enough potential difference, atoms are hurled at each other with enough energy to overcome the coulomb force.</p>
                    
            <p>If deuterium is introduced to the chamber,a D-D fusion reaction can occur. With 50% of these reactions producing a neutron alongside a He-3 atom, neutrons are used to prove the reaction has occurred. I designed and calibrated my own system for thermalizing and detecting neutrons.</p>
                    
            <p>Despite its inability to provide sustainable electricity to the power grid, this style of reactor does still serve a purpose in research and in generating radioisotopes for medical use.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/fusion/writing2.png">

            <p >This project gave me a lot of practice in producing scrappy solutions: often times I would buy something very cheaply on eBay, modify it to fit my needs, and then implement it into the reactor system.</p>

            <p>Though this may be a cliche, the most important skill I learned was persevering through prolonged adversity and challenges. Weeks would often go by with no observable change in progress, and yet I was able to stick to my convictions and power through these dissuading times.</p>

            <p>I also gained significant experience with presenting my work and public speaking, as I was invited to present to groups of academics and seasoned professionals in this space.</p>
